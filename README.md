# Traffic Accident Analysis

This project is a data analysis of traffic accidents, focusing on various factors such as the number of crashes per borough, leading causes of crashes, and vehicle type combinations involved in the most accidents.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding the causes and distribution of accidents across different boroughs.

## Data
The data used in this analysis is sourced from the NYC Open Data portal. It includes information on traffic accidents, such as the number of crashes, vehicle types involved, and the contributing factors.

## Analysis
The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook and involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Removing missing or irrelevant data.
2. Data Exploration: Analyzing the distribution of crashes across different boroughs.
3. Crash Causes: Identifying the leading causes of crashes.
4. Vehicle Combinations: Determining which combinations of vehicle types are involved in the most accidents.

## Results
The analysis yielded several key insights:
- Manhattan has the highest number of crashes relative to its population.
- The most common cause of crashes is driver inattention/distraction.
- The most frequent vehicle combination involved in crashes is two sedans.

## Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-accident-analysis.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd traffic-accident-analysis
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Project_1.ipynb
```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis.
